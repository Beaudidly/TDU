## Abstract
The thruster's nozzle, propellant, and chamber conditions each have a huge impact on performance. The fluid mechanics that model engine effectiveness are pretty complicated, unfortunately. The purpose of this script is to make it easy to see how tweaks in nozzle geometry, propellants, and chamber conditions affect performance in order to find the optimal design solution.

## Scope
* Simulate the performance of a thruster in space for a given set of parameters and output performance metrics.
* Output simulation data in a useful manner.
* Allow the user to easily tweak parameters.
